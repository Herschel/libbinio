libbinio - Binary I/O stream class library

Description:
------------
The binary I/O stream class library presents a platform-independent
way to access binary data streams in C++.

The library is hardware independent in the form that it transparently
converts between the different forms of machine-internal binary data
representation.

It further employs no special I/O protocol and can be used on
arbitrary binary data sources.

CVS:
----
If you checked out from CVS, first run:

autoreconf --install

to generate the build cruft and get the configure script. You need recent
versions of autoconf, automake and libtool to do this.

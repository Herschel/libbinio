<h2 class="chapter">Introduction</h2>

   <p>The binary I/O stream class library (libbinio) presents a
platform-independent way to access binary data streams in C++.

   <p>The library is hardware independent in the form that it transparently
converts between the different forms of machine-internal binary data
representation.

   <p>It further employs no special I/O protocol and can be used on
arbitrary binary data sources.

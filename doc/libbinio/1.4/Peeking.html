<h3 class="section">Peeking</h3>

   <p>Analogous to the <code>readInt()</code> and <code>readFloat()</code> methods are
the <code>peekInt(</code><var>size</var><code>)</code> and <code>peekFloat(</code><var>type</var><code>)</code>
methods, that take the same arguments and also read an integer or a
floating-point number from the stream. Unlike their "<code>read</code>"
counterparts, they don't modify the stream position. The next "real"
access (i.e. with one of the <code>read</code> methods) to the stream will
continue as if the <code>peek</code> methods have never been called.

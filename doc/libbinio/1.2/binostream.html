<h4 class="subsection">binostream</h4>

   <p><code>binostream</code> provides an output-only binary stream.

<h4 class="subheading">Header file: <code>binio.h</code></h4>

<h4 class="subheading">Public methods:</h4>

     <dl>
<dt><code>binostream()</code>
     <dd>The constructor.

     <br><dt><code>~binostream()</code>
     <dd>The destructor.

     <br><dt><code>void writeInt(Int val, unsigned int size);</code>
     <dd>Writes the integer value <code>val</code> of size <code>size</code> (in bytes) to
the stream.

     <br><dt><code>void writeFloat(Float f, FType ft);</code>
     <dd>Writes the floating-point value <code>f</code> of type <code>ft</code> to the
stream. Refer to the list of public types of the <code>binio</code> class
for information about what floating-point formats are supported.

     <p>If the requested floating-point type is not supported by your
architecture, <code>writeFloat()</code> tries to convert it. This is not
always possible and an <code>Unsupported</code> error is issued if the
conversion fails and nothing is written to the stream in this case.

     <br><dt><code>unsigned long writeString(const char *str, unsigned long amount = 0);</code>
     <dd><dt><code>unsigned long writeString(const std::string &amp;str);</code>
     <dd>Writes a character string to the stream. Both standard C
<small>ASCIIZ</small> strings and <small>STL</small> <code>string</code> objects are
supported.

     <p>The standard C version takes a pointer <code>str</code> to the
<small>ASCIIZ</small> string to write as first argument and an optional
second argument <code>amount</code>, which specifies the number of
characters to write from that string. If it is omitted, the whole
string is written to the stream.

     <p>For the <code>string</code> object version, the only argument is the
<code>string</code> object, containing the string to write.

     <p>Both methods return the number of characters actually written to the
stream (which should only differ from the value you wanted to write
when an error occured). 
</dl>

<h4 class="subheading">Protected methods:</h4>

     <dl>
<dt><code>virtual void putByte(Byte)</code>
     <dd>Abstract virtual method to insert exactly one byte (8 bits) into the
stream and advance the stream pointer accordingly. The byte to be
written is passed as the only argument. Implemented by the stream
layer. 
</dl>

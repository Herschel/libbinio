<h4 class="subsection">File stream classes</h4>

   <p>The binary file streams consist of the classes <code>binifstream</code>,
<code>binofstream</code> and <code>binfstream</code>. They all inherit the
interface from both <code>binfbase</code> and <code>binistream</code> and/or
<code>binostream</code>. Refer to the class reference of these classes for
more information on the interface instead.

   <p><code>binifstream</code> provides an input-only binary file stream. It is
inherited from <code>binistream</code>. The <code>open()</code> method of this
class ignores all passed <code>mode</code> arguments, the open mode is
always <code>NoCreate</code>. The stream pointer is always positioned at the
beginning of the stream and no files will ever be created, if they
don't exist.

   <p><code>binofstream</code> provides an output-only binary file stream. It is
inherited from <code>binostream</code>. The default open mode is
<code>0</code>. A file is truncated to zero length or created if it did not
exist previously. The stream is positioned at the beginning of the
file. The <code>NoCreate</code> mode flag has no effect with the
<code>open()</code> method of this class. Only <code>Append</code> is honored,
positioning the stream at the end of the file and not truncating
it. The file is still created, if it did not exist.

   <p><code>binfstream</code> provides an input and output supporting binary file
stream. It is inherited from both <code>binifstream</code> and
<code>binofstream</code>. The default open mode is <code>0</code>. A file is
truncated to zero length or created if it did not exist
previously. The stream is positioned at the beginning of the file. All
<code>mode</code> arguments are valid with the <code>open()</code> method of this
class. Refer to the list of public data types and variables of the
<code>binfbase</code> class for more information on their meaning.

   <p>All three classes define an extra convenience constructor that has the
same syntax as the <code>open()</code> method and automatically open the
specified file on object construction.

   <p>For your information, here is a list of some important redefined
methods of these classes, as explained above:

<h4 class="subheading">Header file: <code>binfile.h</code></h4>

<h4 class="subheading">Public methods:</h4>

     <dl>
<dt><code>binifstream()</code>
     <dd><dt><code>binofstream()</code>
     <dd><dt><code>binfstream()</code>
     <dd>All standard constructors.

     <br><dt><code>~binifstream()</code>
     <dd><dt><code>~binofstream()</code>
     <dd><dt><code>~binfstream()</code>
     <dd>All standard destructors. They all automatically close an eventually
open stream, on object deconstruction.

     <br><dt><code>binifstream(const char *filename, const Mode mode = NoCreate)</code>
     <dd><dt><code>binifstream(const std::string &amp;filename, const Mode mode = NoCreate)</code>
     <dd>Convenience constructors of the input-only stream class. Refer to the
description of the <code>open()</code> method in the list of public methods
of the <code>binfbase</code> class for syntax information.

     <br><dt><code>binofstream(const char *filename, const Mode mode = 0)</code>
     <dd><dt><code>binofstream(const std::string &amp;filename, const Mode mode = 0)</code>
     <dd>Convenience constructors of the output-only stream class. Refer to the
description of the <code>open()</code> method in the list of public methods
of the <code>binfbase</code> class for syntax information.

     <br><dt><code>binfstream(const char *filename, const Mode mode = 0)</code>
     <dd><dt><code>binfstream(const std::string &amp;filename, const Mode mode = 0)</code>
     <dd>Convenience constructors of the input and output supporting stream
class. Refer to the description of the <code>open()</code> method in the
list of public methods of the <code>binfbase</code> class for syntax
information.

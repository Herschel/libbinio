<h3 class="section">Configuration</h3>

   <p>libbinio can be configured in various ways at compile time and some
parts of the library can be disabled to save disk space and/or
processing speed.

   <p>In some cases, these configuration options directly change parts of
the interface and must thus also be known by the library user.

   <p>To make these options available to the library user, libbinio defines
some C preprocessor macros in <code>binio.h</code>. These are:

     <dl>
<dt><code>BINIO_ENABLE_STRING</code>
     <dd>If this macro expands to <code>1</code>, <small>STL</small> <code>string</code> object
support is enabled and can be used instead of traditional C
<small>ASCIIZ</small> pointers with all functions that expect a string
somewhere. It expands to <code>0</code> otherwise. 
<br><dt><code>BINIO_ENABLE_IOSTREAM</code>
     <dd>If this macro expands to <code>1</code>, the iostream wrapper classes are
enabled and can be used by the library user. It expands to <code>0</code>
otherwise and no iostream wrapper classes are present in this case. 
<br><dt><code>BINIO_ISO_STDLIB</code>
     <dd>If this macro expands to <code>1</code>, libbinio's iostream wrapper classes
are taylored for the <small>ISO</small> standard C++ library, instead of a
"traditional" iostream implementation. It expands to <code>0</code>
otherwise. This macro is merely for libbinio's internal use and should
not be used by an application programmer. 
<br><dt><code>BINIO_WITH_MATH</code>
     <dd>This macro is for libbinio's internal use and should not be used by an
application programmer. 
</dl>

   <p>All macros are <em>always</em> defined. The decision whether a feature
is enabled in the library has to be based on the value of these
macros, not whether they are defined or not.

<h3 class="section">Features</h3>

   <p>libbinio implements a generalized binary stream class framework, with
the following features:

     <ul>
<li>The ability to read arbitrary-sized integers, as long as the
underlying system can hold the final value. 
<li>Conversion between Big- and Little-Endian storage. 
<li>Reading and writing of <small>IEEE-754</small> single and double
precision floating-point numbers and the conversion to/from any
system-internal floating-point representation. 
</ul>

   <p>libbinio provides classes for streaming access to normal files,
arbitrary data strings in memory and a wrapper around standard
iostreams from either the <small>ISO</small> standard C++ library, or a
"traditional" iostream implementation.

   <p>In addition, convenience methods for the <small>STL</small> <code>string</code>
class can be enabled that support reading and writing of arbitrary
length strings with dynamic memory allocation.

   <p>libbinio should compile and run on as much systems as possible. If it
doesn't work with your system/compiler combination, please tell me!

<h3 class="section">Wrapping around iostream</h3>

   <p>libbinio provides a set of classes, called <code>binwstream</code>,
<code>biniwstream</code> and <code>binowstream</code>, that can be wrapped around
an already existing stream from the standard or traditional C++
iostream library.

   <p>To do this, you just have to pass a pointer to the original stream
object from the iostream library to the constructor of the appropriate
<code>binwstream</code> class. Of course, you have to match an input stream
from the iostream library to an input stream from libbinio and
analogous for the output-only streams. The class framework will
prevent you from mismatching them. You can, however, wrap an
unidirectional binary stream around a bidirectional stream from the
iostream library.

   <p>There is one important thing you have to remember: If you plan to wrap
a binary stream around an iostream stream, always open the iostream
stream with the <code>ios::bin</code> mode flag set! This will prevent some
operating systems (namely, MS-DOS and Windows) from doing nasty
implicit interpretation on the streams. This definitly will impose
problems when you try to read or write the binary stream.

   <p>All other flags, you set when opening the original iostream stream,
can indirectly have effect on the operations you do on the wrapped
binary stream.

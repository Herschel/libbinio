<h3 class="section">Files</h3>

   <p>For the most part, you will want to use libbinio to access normal
binary files on your filesystem.

   <p>This is what the <code>binfstream</code> related classes are for. To use
them, you first have to include the file <code>binfile.h</code> within your
code.

   <p>This file contains four class declarations - <code>binfbase</code>,
<code>binifstream</code>, <code>binofstream</code> and
<code>binfstream</code>. <code>binfbase</code> is a base class for the others and
normally not used by an ordinary libbinio user. This leaves us with
three usable classes.

   <p>To create a binary stream on a file, just instantiate one of the three
classes, according to what I/O facilities the stream should provide
(see <a href="Basics.html#Basics">Basics</a> for information on the class naming conventions).

   <p>To open a file, you use the <code>open(</code><var>filename</var><code>, [</code><var>mode</var><code>])</code>
method of one of the classes. <var>filename</var> is a string (both C style
<small>ASCIIZ</small> strings and <small>STL</small> <code>string</code> objects can
be passed, if supported by your compiler) containing the name of the
file to open. Additionally, you can pass a <var>mode</var> argument to
specify a special way to open the file - this is described
later. There's also a special constructor, provided for convenience,
that opens up a file automatically when the object is created. It has
exactly the same syntax as <code>open()</code>.

   <p>After usage, you can explicitly close the file with the <code>close()</code>
method. It is always a good idea to do this explicitly, though not
needed because the file automatically will be closed on object
deconstruction.

<h3 class="section">Base classes</h3>

   <p>The base classes provide a common base for all derived libbinio stream
classes. They define important methods, types and variables.

   <p>One general and three stream base classes are defined in the file
<code>binio.h</code>, which make up the libbinio base classes.

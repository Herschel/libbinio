<h3 class="section">Seeking</h3>

   <p>Sometimes, you need to reposition within your stream. To do this, you
use the <code>seek(</code><var>position</var><code>, [</code><var>offset</var><code>])</code>
method. <var>position</var> is the new position in the stream, counted
byte-wise and starting at <code>0</code>. The optional argument <var>offset</var>
specifies from where the method should seek. If it is <code>Set</code>,
counting is started at the beginning of the stream. <code>Add</code>
indicates to seek from the current stream position and <code>End</code>
means seeking from the end of the stream. Note that <var>position</var> is
a signed integer value and you can also seek backwards by inserting a
negative number.

   <p>You can use the <code>pos()</code> method to determine your current position
within the stream, which is returned by the method.

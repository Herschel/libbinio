<h3 class="section">Concepts</h3>

   <p>The libbinio stream classes can be divided into two layers of
functionality:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>The <dfn>conversion layer</dfn> provides methods for transparently
converting the data, that has just been read from or is to be written
to a stream, between the current and the alien architecture. The
<code>binistream</code>, <code>binostream</code> and <code>binstream</code> classes
belong to this layer. 
<li>The <dfn>stream layer</dfn> faciliates functionality on the stream
level. It provides methods for byte-by-byte access to the data,
seeking, opening and closing a stream and anything else related to the
maintenance of a stream. The <code>binfstream</code>, <code>binwstream</code> and
<code>binsstream</code> related classes belong to this layer.
        </ol>

   <p>Additionally, there are some administrative and auxiliary classes
provided, which do not belong to any of the above defined layers. The
<code>binio</code> base class belongs here, for example.

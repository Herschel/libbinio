   <p>The binary stream class framework divides streams into
<dfn>input-only</dfn>,
<dfn>output-only</dfn> and
<dfn>input/output</dfn> supporting
streams. All derived classes also inherit this partition.

   <p>All derived classes that come with the library follow a uniform naming
scheme. You can identify what I/O facilities a stream provides, by
looking at the class name. All class names of libbinio start with
<code>bin</code> and end with a descriptive name of what they are meant
for. In between is at most one character that describes what I/O
functionality is provided. If this character is an <code>i</code>, the class
provides input-only streams, <code>o</code> means output-only and no
character indicates both input and output facilities.

   <p>For example, <code>binifstream</code> is an input-only binary stream for
standard file access. <code>binstream</code> is the general input and output
supporting stream.

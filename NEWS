This is a brief overview of user-visible changes in libbinio.

Changes for version 1.1:
- Removed unused config header file.
- writeString() now reports number of characters written.
- Changed behaviour of readString(): The delimiter doesn't default to '\0'
  anymore. If no delimiter is given, always up to 'amount' characters are read.
